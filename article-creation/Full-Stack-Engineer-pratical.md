Creating a practical interview test for a full stack engineer should evaluate their proficiency in both front-end and back-end development, integration skills, and understanding of best practices in web development. Below is a comprehensive practical interview test designed for a full stack engineering role:

### Full Stack Engineer Practical Interview Test

**Objective**: Assess the candidate’s skills in developing, integrating, and deploying a complete web application using modern web technologies.

#### Part 1: Front-End Development
- **Task**: Create a responsive user interface for a to-do list application using a front-end framework (e.g., React, Angular, or Vue.js).
- **Requirements**:
  - The UI should allow users to add, edit, delete, and mark tasks as completed.
  - Implement state management (e.g., React’s `useState` or Vue’s `reactive`).
  - Ensure the design is mobile-friendly with basic styling (using CSS or a preprocessor like SASS).
- **Deliverables**:
  - Source code for the front-end component.
  - Screenshot or live demo link of the application.

#### Part 2: Back-End Development
- **Task**: Create a RESTful API to support the to-do list application using Node.js and Express or another back-end framework of choice (e.g., Django or Flask for Python).
- **Requirements**:
  - Implement CRUD operations for tasks.
  - Connect to a database (e.g., MongoDB, PostgreSQL).
  - Implement basic validation for inputs.
- **Deliverables**:
  - Source code for the back-end service.
  - API documentation detailing the endpoints and usage.

#### Part 3: Integration
- **Task**: Connect the front-end application to the back-end API.
- **Requirements**:
  - Ensure the UI updates dynamically based on data from the server.
  - Implement error handling for failed requests (e.g., server errors or network issues).
- **Deliverables**:
  - Integrated project files.
  - Instructions on how to set up and run the full project locally.

#### Part 4: Authentication and Authorization
- **Task**: Add user authentication to the application using JWT (JSON Web Token) or another secure method.
- **Requirements**:
  - Implement user registration and login endpoints on the back end.
  - Protect routes that require user authentication.
  - Display a user-specific to-do list after login.
- **Deliverables**:
  - Updated code with authentication functionality.
  - Example user credentials for testing.

#### Part 5: Deployment
- **Task**: Deploy the full stack application to a cloud service (e.g., AWS, Heroku, or Vercel).
- **Requirements**:
  - The deployed application should be accessible via a public URL.
  - Include CI/CD setup (e.g., GitHub Actions) for automated testing and deployment.
- **Deliverables**:
  - Deployment link to the live application.
  - Documentation explaining the deployment process and how the CI/CD pipeline works.

#### Part 6: Code Optimization and Best Practices
- **Task**: Review your code and implement optimization techniques for both front-end and back-end.
- **Requirements**:
  - Optimize database queries to minimize load time.
  - Implement caching where necessary.
  - Ensure the application follows secure coding practices.
- **Deliverables**:
  - List of optimizations made.
  - Explanation of the security practices applied.

#### Part 7: Bonus Task (Optional)
- **Task**: Add real-time features using WebSockets (e.g., notify users when a task is updated by another user).
- **Deliverables**:
  - Real-time functionality implementation in code.
  - Explanation of how WebSockets are used in the application.

### Evaluation Criteria
- **Technical Proficiency**: Ability to build and integrate both front-end and back-end components.
- **Code Quality**: Readability, maintainability, and adherence to best practices.
- **Problem-solving**: Effective handling of common challenges (e.g., error handling, security concerns).
- **Performance**: Responsiveness and speed of the application.
- **Deployment and CI/CD**: Understanding and implementation of deployment pipelines.
- **Documentation**: Clarity and thoroughness of instructions and API documentation.

This practical test evaluates the comprehensive skill set required for a full stack engineering role, ensuring candidates demonstrate their abilities across the full software development lifecycle.
