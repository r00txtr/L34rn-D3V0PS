Ensure that your system is up to date and you have installed the gnupg, software-properties-common, and curl packages installed. You will use these packages to verify HashiCorp's GPG signature and install HashiCorp's Debian package repository.

$ sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y gnupg software-properties-common

Install the HashiCorp GPG key.

$ wget -O- <https://apt.releases.hashicorp.com/gpg> | \
gpg --dearmor | \
sudo tee /usr/share/keyrings/hashicorp-archive-keyring.gpg > /dev/null

Verify the key's fingerprint.

$ gpg --no-default-keyring \
--keyring /usr/share/keyrings/hashicorp-archive-keyring.gpg \
--fingerprint

The gpg command will report the key fingerprint:

/usr/share/keyrings/hashicorp-archive-keyring.gpg
-------------------------------------------------

pub   rsa4096 XXXX-XX-XX [SC]
AAAA AAAA AAAA AAAA
uid           [ unknown] HashiCorp Security (HashiCorp Package Signing) <security+packaging@hashicorp.com>
sub   rsa4096 XXXX-XX-XX [E]

Add the official HashiCorp repository to your system. The lsb_release -cs command finds the distribution release codename for your current system, such as buster, groovy, or sid.

$ echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/hashicorp-archive-keyring.gpg] \
https://apt.releases.hashicorp.com $(lsb_release -cs) main" | \
sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/hashicorp.list

Download the package information from HashiCorp.

$ sudo apt update

Install Terraform from the new repository.

$ sudo apt-get install terraform

Enable tab completion
If you use either Bash or Zsh, you can enable tab completion for Terraform commands. To enable autocomplete, first ensure that a config file exists for your chosen shell.


Bash
$ touch ~/.bashrc

Then install the autocomplete package.

$ terraform -install-autocomplete

Once the autocomplete support is installed, you will need to restart your shell.

Quick start tutorial
Now that you've installed Terraform, you can provision an NGINX server in less than a minute using Docker on Mac, Windows, or Linux. You can also follow the rest of this tutorial in your web browser.

Create a directory named learn-terraform-docker-container.

$ mkdir learn-terraform-docker-container

This working directory houses the configuration files that you write to describe the infrastructure you want Terraform to create and manage. When you initialize and apply the configuration here, Terraform uses this directory to store required plugins, modules (pre-written configurations), and information about the real infrastructure it created.

Navigate into the working directory.

$ cd learn-terraform-docker-container

In the working directory, create a file called main.tf and paste the following Terraform configuration into it.

terraform {
  required_providers {
    docker = {
      source  = "kreuzwerker/docker"
      version = "~> 3.0.1"
    }
  }
}

provider "docker" {}

resource "docker_image" "nginx" {
  name         = "nginx"
  keep_locally = false
}

resource "docker_container" "nginx" {
  image = docker_image.nginx.image_id
  name  = "tutorial"

  ports {
    internal = 80
    external = 8000
  }
}

Initialize the project, which downloads a plugin called a provider that lets Terraform interact with Docker.

$ terraform init

Provision the NGINX server container with apply. When Terraform asks you to confirm type yes and press ENTER.

$ terraform apply

Verify the existence of the NGINX container by visiting localhost:8000 in your web browser or running docker ps to see the container.

$ docker ps
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                     COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                    NAMES
425d5ee58619        e791337790a6              "nginx -g 'daemon ofâ€¦"   20 seconds ago      Up 19 seconds       0.0.0.0:8000->80/tcp     tutorial

To stop the container, run terraform destroy.

$ terraform destroy

You've now provisioned and destroyed an NGINX webserver with Terraform.
