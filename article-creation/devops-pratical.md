Creating a practical interview test for a DevOps role involves assessing skills in multiple key areas, including continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD), infrastructure as code (IaC), configuration management, containerization, and monitoring. Here’s a sample DevOps practical interview test designed to evaluate these skills:

### DevOps Practical Interview Test

**Objective**: Evaluate the candidate's ability to build, deploy, and manage an application in a cloud-native environment using DevOps practices.

#### Part 1: Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
- **Task**: Create a script using Terraform (or Ansible) to provision an EC2 instance on AWS.
- **Requirements**:
  - The script should launch an EC2 instance running Ubuntu.
  - Ensure SSH access is configured.
  - Install Apache HTTP server and configure it to serve a sample web page.
- **Deliverables**:
  - Terraform/Ansible script files.
  - Documentation explaining how to execute the script and verify the setup.

#### Part 2: CI/CD Pipeline
- **Task**: Create a CI/CD pipeline using a tool like Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD, or GitHub Actions.
- **Requirements**:
  - Set up a pipeline that triggers on code commit.
  - The pipeline should run tests, build a Docker image, and push it to Docker Hub or a private container registry.
  - Deploy the Docker image to a Kubernetes cluster (using Minikube or an actual cloud service).
- **Deliverables**:
  - CI/CD pipeline configuration files.
  - Documentation for pipeline setup and how to view deployment results.

#### Part 3: Containerization
- **Task**: Dockerize a simple web application (e.g., a Node.js app).
- **Requirements**:
  - Create a Dockerfile for the application.
  - Ensure the container exposes a port for access.
- **Deliverables**:
  - Dockerfile and related code.
  - Instructions on how to build and run the Docker container.

#### Part 4: Monitoring and Logging
- **Task**: Set up monitoring and logging for the deployed application.
- **Requirements**:
  - Use Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring or a cloud-based solution like AWS CloudWatch.
  - Implement logging using ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana) or another tool (e.g., Loki).
- **Deliverables**:
  - Configuration files for the monitoring and logging setup.
  - Screenshots or a link to a dashboard that displays metrics and logs.

#### Part 5: Configuration Management
- **Task**: Automate configuration management using a tool like Ansible or Chef.
- **Requirements**:
  - Create a playbook/recipe that sets up an environment on a VM, installing necessary software (e.g., NGINX, Node.js).
- **Deliverables**:
  - Configuration management script.
  - Steps for running the script and verifying its success.

#### Part 6: Troubleshooting
- **Scenario**: The web application is not accessible after deployment.
- **Task**: Diagnose and resolve issues such as:
  - Incorrect container configuration.
  - Networking issues within the cluster.
  - Misconfigured firewall or security group settings.
- **Deliverables**:
  - A report explaining how you identified and fixed the problem.

### Evaluation Criteria
- **Completeness**: How well the candidate meets all the requirements for each task.
- **Clarity**: The quality of the documentation and how easy it is to follow.
- **Problem-solving**: Demonstrated ability to troubleshoot and solve issues.
- **Efficiency**: Effective use of best practices in IaC, CI/CD, and configuration management.

This practical test covers the essential skills for a DevOps role and gives a comprehensive insight into a candidate’s hands-on abilities.
