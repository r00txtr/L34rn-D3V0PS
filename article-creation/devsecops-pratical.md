Creating a practical interview test for DevSecOps involves assessing a candidate's ability to integrate security practices within the DevOps pipeline. This ensures secure coding, vulnerability management, and adherence to best practices throughout the software development lifecycle. Below is a comprehensive practical interview test for a DevSecOps role:

### DevSecOps Practical Interview Test

**Objective**: Evaluate the candidate's skills in securing the DevOps pipeline, including secure coding, vulnerability scanning, and ensuring compliance.

#### Part 1: Secure Code Review
- **Task**: Review a provided codebase (e.g., a Node.js or Python web application) for security vulnerabilities.
- **Requirements**:
  - Identify and list security issues like SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and improper error handling.
  - Suggest secure coding practices to fix the identified issues.
- **Deliverables**:
  - A report highlighting potential vulnerabilities and their remediation.

#### Part 2: CI/CD Pipeline Security
- **Task**: Set up a CI/CD pipeline that includes security checks using a tool like Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD, or GitHub Actions.
- **Requirements**:
  - Integrate a static application security testing (SAST) tool such as SonarQube or CodeQL into the pipeline.
  - Add a step for dependency scanning using tools like OWASP Dependency-Check or Snyk.
  - Ensure the pipeline fails if critical vulnerabilities are detected.
- **Deliverables**:
  - CI/CD pipeline configuration files.
  - Documentation detailing how to set up and run the pipeline, including how security results are presented.

#### Part 3: Container Security
- **Task**: Build and secure a Docker container for a simple web application.
- **Requirements**:
  - Create a Dockerfile that follows best practices for security (e.g., using non-root users, minimizing image size).
  - Run a vulnerability scan on the Docker image using tools like Trivy or Anchore.
- **Deliverables**:
  - Dockerfile and scan reports.
  - Documentation explaining security measures taken.

#### Part 4: Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Security
- **Task**: Write a Terraform script to provision cloud infrastructure (e.g., an EC2 instance) and ensure it follows security best practices.
- **Requirements**:
  - Implement security measures such as encrypted storage, security groups with restricted access, and logging.
  - Use a tool like Checkov or tfsec to scan the script for misconfigurations.
- **Deliverables**:
  - Terraform script and scan reports.
  - Steps on how to execute the script and verify compliance.

#### Part 5: Runtime Security and Monitoring
- **Task**: Implement runtime security using tools like Falco or a cloud provider’s native security solution.
- **Requirements**:
  - Set up rules to detect anomalies such as unexpected network connections or changes in system files.
  - Deploy a basic alerting system using Prometheus and Grafana or a cloud-native solution.
- **Deliverables**:
  - Configuration files for runtime security.
  - A brief report on how alerts are generated and monitored.

#### Part 6: Incident Response and Forensics
- **Scenario**: A simulated security breach is detected where suspicious activities are occurring within a deployed container.
- **Task**: Investigate the breach using security logs and forensics tools.
- **Requirements**:
  - Use tools like Sysdig or cloud logging solutions to trace and analyze the activity.
  - Write a report detailing the investigation process, findings, and remediation actions taken.
- **Deliverables**:
  - Investigation report and logs.

### Evaluation Criteria
- **Security Awareness**: Ability to identify and address security vulnerabilities.
- **Automation Skills**: Proficiency in integrating security tools within the CI/CD pipeline.
- **Compliance and Best Practices**: Demonstrated knowledge of security best practices for IaC and containerization.
- **Problem-solving**: Capacity to respond to and investigate security incidents effectively.
- **Documentation**: Clarity and comprehensiveness of the documentation provided.

This test helps assess a candidate’s practical knowledge in integrating security into the DevOps pipeline, which is crucial for a successful DevSecOps role.
